    "# Automating Reports\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn how to set up *automated reporting* with code, by which we mean creating outputs such as PDF files, Microsoft Word (or open office) text documents, and even slides where the content is partly text and partly generated by code. For example, a technical report exploring recent trade statistics in which the code part pulls down the latest data and plots it. Best of all, you can decide whether to hide or show the code parts in the final outputs (or, with html outputs, allow users to choose whether to see the code or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter has some similarities with the previous chapter, on {ref}`auto-research-outputs` (and uses some of the same underlying technology). But whereas that chapter was about using the LaTeX typesetting language to create research documents and slides that include automatically generated outputs, this chapter skips out any typesetting with LaTeX shows how to create outputs that go straight from the code to the documents and slides. Although LaTeX gives you full control over how outputs look, it comes with a fairly big overhead and the approach in this chapter trades off control for less complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The key use cases for the automated reports in this chapter are sharing documents or slides with colleagues or co-authors within an organisation or collaboration*. In more detail, this includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- reports that use data and/or charts and that are similar each time they are run (eg only the data are updated)\n",
    "- technical reports that show or use the functionality of an existing code base\n",
    "- slide decks that summarise the most recent data and that are produced at a regular frequency\n",
    "- sending exploratory or prototype analysis to co-authors or collaborators\n",
    "- writing blogs for blogging services that accept `.md` files (make sure to export to markdown)\n",
    "- amazingly, it can also be used to create automatically updated websites relatively easily——we won't cover that in this chapter, but you can find some [information on this here](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this chapter, you will need an installation of **Jupyter Lab** (which can be installed via `pip install jupyterlab`), an installation of a programme called [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/), and the other Python packages as used below. For some types of output, you'll also need to have an installation of the typesetting language **LaTeX**, for which this book recommends the [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/download) distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter has benefitted from work on automated reporting templates by the ever-talented [Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automated Reports with **Quarto**\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool that we'll be using to do this is [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/). You'll need to go to the website and follow the [install instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html) first. You can check you've installed it properly using `quarto check install` on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quarto** is a really convenient wrapper for a bunch of other tools that makes it convenient to produce automated reports. You should check the latest [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/quarto-basics.html) for an up to date guide on use——here, we're going to see the basics and introduce a couple of templates that will serve you well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quarto can be used to create *output* documents and slides in a wide variety of formats including HTML, PDF, Microsoft Office (docx and pptx), OpenOffice, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write the *input* documents (and code) in two possible ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A special kind of markdown file, with extension `.qmd`. For more on markdown, see {ref}`wrkflow-markdown`.\n",
    "2. Jupyter Notebooks, with extension `.ipynb` (which most of this book is written in)\n",
    "\n",
    "You optionally add code (e.g. Python, R, JavaScript, etc.) to the documents to dynamically create figures, tables, etc. and then render the documents to their final format using Quarto.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only want to work one way, this book recommends the latter, using Jupyter Notebooks. But some of the key principles for both will be covered in the next sub-section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A minimal example of a report written with markdown content\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now going to try the most minimal example of the first approach, a `.qmd` file, that also includes code and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are advantages and disadvantages to writing your report in the `.qmd` format. The advantage is that it's just a plain text file and therefore anyone can open it, look at it, and change it with a text editor (and it's more convenient for version control in this way too). The big, big disadvantage is that you cannot see how the code is coming on as you write it (you have to render it to see the code outputs, as we'll see in a moment). In the next sub-section, we'll see a way of achieving a better workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get our minimal example setup. The below code and markdown form the content of a file called `report.qmd`:\n",

    "### A minimal example of a report written with Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also write your reports with Jupyter Notebooks. As a reminder, these have cells that can be either text (in the form of markdown) or code (and they support a lot of languages), and have the file format `.ipynb`. This book recommends working with them in Visual Studio Code. Google Colab notebooks are a type of Jupyter notebook (and can be downloaded as `.ipynb` files).\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing your automated reports in Jupyter Notebooks has one major advantage over using `.qmd` markdown files: you can run the code as you go, so you know what you're getting and it's easier to weed out bugs. This book recommends this approach to writing automated reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is the difference from what we've seen above? Very little, actually. Your content will still start with exactly the same header but this time it's going to be in a *markdown cell* at the top of your notebook. To be explicit, the first cell in your notebook will have:\n",

    "number-sections: true\n",
    "jupyter: python3\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent cells will be code or markdown depending on whether you need rich outputs (figures and tables) or text. So, instead of a code chunk that begins with ```` ```{python} ```` like in the `.qmd` approach, you will just create a new code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that putting `format: pdf` into this header will mean that the `render` command automatically produces a pdf. You can change it to `format: html` to default to a html file instead—and both options can be over-written by passing `--to format`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, you can create text that is dynamically updated with code outputs too; just choose a code cell rather than a markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference when it comes to Jupyter Notebooks is that you must decide whether you want to *execute* the notebook before you render it with **Quarto**. Executing a notebook just means run the code before exporting it to a new format. (As an aside, the best practice way to use Jupyter Notebooks is to save them without any code outputs, so execute and render would be the standard way of doing it.) The terminal command to run a notebook and render it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "quarto render jupyter-report.ipynb --execute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new Jupyter Notebook called `jupyter-report.ipynb` with the header above. Re-use the blocks of code and text from the `qmd` example in the previous section. Render it with the command above.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To change the output type, add another instruction to the command using `--to`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "quarto render jupyter-report.ipynb --execute --to html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Customisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimal examples we saw above may not cover everything you want to do. You can look at the Quarto [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html) for more features and customisation options.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Optimal Workflow for Writing Automated Reports\n",
    "\n",
    "We now turn to a big tip on the optimal workflow for making automated reports and slides. Often you are interested in seeing how the final report will look as you change the code in *real time*. This is possible with Jupyter Notebooks and **Quarto**. Run the following in the terminal\n",
