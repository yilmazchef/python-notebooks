    "# Automating Research Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn how to automate the inclusion of figures and tables in LaTeX-derived research outputs including PDFs and slides——plus how to convert those outputs to Microsoft Word documents and more. Much of what you'll see in this chapter applies to a wide range of coding languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter has some similarities with the next chapter, on {ref}`auto-reports`. But this chapter puts the LaTeX typesetting language front and centre, because it's the *de facto* standard for preparing *research outputs* (most journals have a LaTeX template for submission, for example), and it gives you full control over every aspect of how your outputs look. However, if you don't already know LaTeX, there is a steep-ish learning curve and—if you're just looking to create some automated reports using code and text rather than write pre-prints, working papers, journal articles, or academic-talk style slide decks—the next chapter on {ref}`auto-reports` is going to be a better and easier fit for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automating the inclusion of figures and tables in your research outputs has many benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- once configured, it's clearly *easier* than manual updates\n",
    "- your paper can update at the touch of a button\n",
    "- it helps with creating a *reproducible analytical pipeline* (for more on these, see the {ref}`wrkflow-rap` chapter).\n",
    "- it enforces structure on your project\n",
    "- automation is complementary to other good practices such as version control\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now turn to the how.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Including research outputs in LaTeX documents and slides\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you're writing a paper, using $\\LaTeX$, or a presentation, using $\\LaTeX$ and beamer. (Perhaps you'd like the final document or presentation to be in Word, Powerpoint-that's okay too, and we'll come to it shortly, but let's assume you're *writing* it in $\\LaTeX$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Including code outputs is pretty simple, but is slightly different for figures and tables (the two main outputs you might include).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figures\n",
    "\n",
    "For figures, the $\\LaTeX$ **graphicx** package is your friend as it allows you to set a directory where your figures live, for example `outputs/figures`, which would be set like this at the top of the document:\n",
    "\n",
    "```latex\n",
    "\\usepackage{graphicx}\n",
    "\\graphicspath{{outputs/figures/}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We're imagining here that we have a project structure like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "code.py\n",
    "paper.tex\n",
    "outputs/\n",
    "    figures/\n",
    "        chart.pdf\n",
    "    tables/\n",
    "        reg_table.tex\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, whenever you need to include a figure, say `chart.pdf`, you can always do it using\n",
    "\n",
    "```latex\n",
    "\\begin{figure}\n",
    "\t\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{chart.pdf}\n",
    "\t\\caption{Example figure. \\label{fig:example}}\n",
    "\\end{figure}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend `chart.pdf` is generated by the most popular Python graphics library, **matplotlib**. The code in 'code.py' which puts the chart in the 'figures' folder could look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
    "ax.scatter(range(5), range(5), s=50, c='b')\n",
    "plt.savefig(\"outputs/figures/chart.pdf\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The important line here is `plt.savefig(\"outputs/figures/chart.pdf\")` because it says to save the figure in the 'figures' directory. When you re-run your code, the chart ends up in the right place. When you re-compile your $\\LaTeX$ document or presentation, it can pick the chart up from the right place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's imagine you've created a table of descriptive statistics such as the one below:"

    "What's surprising is how effective the conversion to word is: even if you have figures, equations, and other non-text features.\n",

    "You can get quite fancy with **pandoc**, for example you can translate a whole book's worth of latex into a Word doc complete with a Word style, a bibliography via biblatex, equations, and figures. Nothing can save Word from being painful to use, but **pandoc** certainly helps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a real example of doing all of that, taken from an open source [**cookie-cutter-latex-book-manuscript**](https://github.com/aeturrell/cookie-cutter-latex-book-manuscript) written by a contributor to Coding for Economists:\n",
    "\n",

    "- `-s` tells pandoc to make a standalone document\n",
    "- `-N` enforces numbering (though not in docx, it's included here in case of other output formats being used)\n",
    "- `--reference-doc` tells pandoc to use styles from a reference word doc (can also be used with .odt)\n",
    "- `-F` calls a pandoc filter, in this case pandoc-crossref\n",
    "- `-Mchapters` tells this filter to use chapters\n",
    "- `*.tex` is the input file\n",
    "- `--bibliography=*.bib` tells pandoc where to find citations\n",
    "- `--csl=*.csl` is the name of the style file for citations, here one based on the style of the journal *Nature*\n",
