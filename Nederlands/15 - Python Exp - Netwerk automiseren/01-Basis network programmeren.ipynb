The main use of Python is to build different scripts that can automate specific complex network configurations. Complete support to the network protocols is provided by the standard library of Python. Python is much more useful than other languages in networking because of the code simplicity. Task automation for all the complex tasks is made easy with the help of python programming. This is how Python is utilized in networking.\n",

For instance, if you wish to create and run any local web server or directly download some files in your system from a URL, you can make use of Python Network Programming.\n",
