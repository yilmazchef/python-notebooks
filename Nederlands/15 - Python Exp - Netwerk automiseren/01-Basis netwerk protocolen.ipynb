    "# Basic networking:\n",
    "\n",
    "We deal with information exchange every day. We would have also come across a lot of cases where we need to set up or used a server-client connection. An example of such a case is searching for some topic on google. In this article, we will learn networking in Python, Python’s socket module, and also setting up a client-server network using the socket module. So let us start with the basics of networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Networking is basically the process of two devices interacting and exchanging data. But how do the devices identify each other? The IP address (Internet Protocol address) and port number are the two things that do this job.\n",
    "\n",
    "IP address helps in identifying the host/computer on the network and the port is used to find the application/services on the device. The IP address can be thought of as the city/town name and the port as the street address. These both are required to form the connection between the computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then what are sockets? When we talk about bidirectional communication, the endpoint or the nodes are called sockets. And the information exchange can happen in any of the following ways:\n",
    "1\\. When the process is going on\n",
    "2\\. Between the process on same or different machines\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, we will be using the socket module to form the network. Before discussing the functions in the socket module and forming the network, let us see some important terms that we need to know in this module."

    "## Terminology in Socket Module\n",
    "\n",
    "We will come across the following terms while dealing with the socket module:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1\\. Domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "When forming the connection, we need to mention the protocol. The domain is the set of these protocols. In Python, we have the constants to represent these protocols and these are AF\\_INET, PF\\_INET, PF\\_UNIX, PF\\_X25, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\\. Type:\n",
    "\n",
    "The communication in a network can be of two types, namely, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). TCP is connection-oriented network, where we need to first form the connection to transmit to the data. WHere as UDP is a connection-less network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to mention SOC\\_STREAM for TCP network and SOC\\_DGRAM for UDP network\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3\\. Protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "This term here defines the protocol used within the domain and the type. By default, it is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4\\. Port:\n",
    "\n",
    "As said before port is the number that identifies the service of the device. We can either give the port number, a service name, or the string of port number as the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5\\. HostName:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is basically the IP address that identifies the device. This can be a string of hostname, the address separated by dots, or an IP6 address. This value can also be an empty string, an integer, or the word “<broadcast>”.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods in Python Socket Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Done with the discussion on the vocabulary of the socket module, let us also discuss the methods.  \n",
    "Before starting any connection or transferring data, we need to first import the socket module. This can be done by writing the following statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "import socket\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we need to create the socket using the socket.socket() function.The syntax of this function is :\n",
    "\n",
    "sct= socket.socket (socket\\_family, socket\\_type, protocol=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "sct= socket.socket (socket\\_family, socket\\_type, protocol=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "sct= socket.socket (socket\\_family, socket\\_type, protocol=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here,  \n",
    "1\\. The socket\\_family can be either AF\\_UNIX or AF\\_INET as said before.\n",
    "2\\. The socket\\_type is either SOC\\_STREAM or SOC\\_DGRAM  \n",
    "3\\. The protocol is usually ignored and set as the default value, i.e.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see an example of creating the socket.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of creating a socket:**\n",
    "\n",
    "sct = socket.socket(socket.AF\\_INET,socket.SOCK\\_STREAM)\n",
    "\n",
    "import socket sct=socket.socket(socket.AF\\_INET,socket.SOCK\\_STREAM) print(sct)\n",
    "\n",
    "import socket \n",
    "sct=socket.socket(socket.AF\\_INET,socket.SOCK\\_STREAM)\n",
    "print(sct)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<socket.socket fd=1244, family=AddressFamily.AF\\_INET, type=SocketKind.SOCK\\_STREAM, proto=0>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the details of the socket created are shown on printing the socket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now see the methods in this module. These methods can be classified into three types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. Methods related to the server: These are the methods used at the server’s send in the network.  \n",
    "2\\. Methods related to the client: These are used by the client while forming the connection  \n",
    "3\\. General methods: These are the methods used at both ends\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see the methods under each category :\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1\\. Socket Methods at Server’s End:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. s.bind():\n",
    "\n",
    "This function binds or combines the address of the socket by taking the hostname and the port as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. s.listen():\n",
    "\n",
    "This function sets up the TCP listener and starts it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. s.accept():\n",
    "\n",
    "This function accepts the connection from the server when it arrives. It blocks or waits until the connection arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\\. Socket Methods at Client’s End:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. s.connect():\n",
    "\n",
    "This function initiates the TCP connection at the client’s end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3\\. General Socket Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. s.send():\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name shows, this function sends the TCP message.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. s.sendto():\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to the above method but is used in the UDP network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. s.recv():\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is used to receive the TCP message.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. s.recvfrom():\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is similar to the recv() function, except that it is used in the UDP network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### e. s.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is used to close the socket to stop the connection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### f. s.gethostname():\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this function we can get the hostname.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation of the network using socket\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now see the implementation of the client-server networking using the socket module and also see the outputs on both sides.\n",
