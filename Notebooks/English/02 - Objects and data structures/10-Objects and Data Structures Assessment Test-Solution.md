[Strings](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jmportilla/Complete-Python-Bootcamp/blob/master/Strings.ipynb)

[Lists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jmportilla/Complete-Python-Bootcamp/blob/master/Lists.ipynb)

[Tuples](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jmportilla/Complete-Python-Bootcamp/blob/master/Tuples.ipynb)

[Dictionaries](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jmportilla/Complete-Python-Bootcamp/blob/master/Dictionaries.ipynb)


## Numbers

Write an equation that uses multiplication, division, an exponent, addition, and subtraction that is equal to 100.25.

Hint: This is just to test your memory of the basic arithmetic commands, work backwards from 100.25


```python
# Your answer is probably different
(60 + (10 ** 2) / 4 * 7) - 134.75
```




    100.25



Answer these 3 questions without typing code. Then type code to check your answer.

    What is the value of the expression 4 * (6 + 5)
    
    What is the value of the expression 4 * 6 + 5 
    
    What is the value of the expression 4 + 6 * 5 


```python
4 * (6 + 5)
```




    44




```python
4 * 6 + 5 
```




    29




```python
4 + 6 * 5 
```




    34



What is the *type* of the result of the expression 3 + 1.5 + 4?

**Answer: Floating Point Number**

What would you use to find a numberâ€™s square root, as well as its square? 


```python
# Square root:
100 ** 0.5
```




    10.0




```python
# Square:
10 ** 2
```




    100



## Strings

Given the string 'hello' give an index command that returns 'e'. Enter your code in the cell below:


```python
s = 'hello'
# Print out 'e' using indexing

s[1]
```




    'e'



Reverse the string 'hello' using slicing:


```python
s ='hello'
# Reverse the string using slicing

s[::-1]
```




    'olleh'



Given the string 'hello', give two methods of producing the letter 'o' using indexing.


```python
s ='hello'
# Print out the 'o'

# Method 1:

s[-1]
```




    'o'




```python
# Method 2:

s[4]
```




    'o'



## Lists

Build this list [0,0,0] two separate ways.


```python
# Method 1:
[0]*3
```




    [0, 0, 0]




```python
# Method 2:
list2 = [0,0,0]
list2
```




    [0, 0, 0]



Reassign 'hello' in this nested list to say 'goodbye' instead:


```python
list3 = [1,2,[3,4,'hello']]
```


```python
list3[2][2] = 'goodbye'
```


```python
list3
```




    [1, 2, [3, 4, 'goodbye']]



Sort the list below:


```python
list4 = [5,3,4,6,1]
```


```python
# Method 1:
sorted(list4)
```




    [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]




```python
# Method 2:
list4.sort()
list4
```




    [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]



## Dictionaries

Using keys and indexing, grab the 'hello' from the following dictionaries:


```python
d = {'simple_key':'hello'}
# Grab 'hello'

d['simple_key']
```




    'hello'




```python
d = {'k1':{'k2':'hello'}}
# Grab 'hello'

d['k1']['k2']
```




    'hello'




```python
# Getting a little tricker
d = {'k1':[{'nest_key':['this is deep',['hello']]}]}
```


```python
# This was harder than I expected...
d['k1'][0]['nest_key'][1][0]
```




    'hello'




```python
# This will be hard and annoying!
d = {'k1':[1,2,{'k2':['this is tricky',{'tough':[1,2,['hello']]}]}]}
```


```python
# Phew!
d['k1'][2]['k2'][1]['tough'][2][0]
```




    'hello'



Can you sort a dictionary? Why or why not?

**Answer: No! Because normal dictionaries are *mappings* not a sequence. **

## Tuples

What is the major difference between tuples and lists?

**Tuples are immutable!**

How do you create a tuple?


```python
t = (1,2,3)
```

## Sets 

What is unique about a set?

**Answer: They don't allow for duplicate items!**

Use a set to find the unique values of the list below:


```python
list5 = [1,2,2,33,4,4,11,22,3,3,2]
```


```python
set(list5)
```




    {1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 22, 33}



## Booleans

For the following quiz questions, we will get a preview of comparison operators. In the table below, a=3 and b=4.

<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="width:10%">Operator</th><th style="width:45%">Description</th><th>Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>==</td>
<td>If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.</td>
<td> (a == b) is not true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>!=</td>
<td>If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.</td>
<td> (a != b) is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;</td>
<td>If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.</td>
<td> (a &gt; b) is not true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;</td>
<td>If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.</td>
<td> (a &lt; b) is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;=</td>
<td>If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.</td>
<td> (a &gt;= b) is not true. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;=</td>
<td>If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.</td>
<td> (a &lt;= b) is true. </td>
</tr>
</table>

What will be the resulting Boolean of the following pieces of code (answer fist then check by typing it in!)


```python
# Answer before running cell
2 > 3
```




    False




```python
# Answer before running cell
3 <= 2
```




    False




```python
# Answer before running cell
3 == 2.0
```




    False




```python
# Answer before running cell
3.0 == 3
```




    True




```python
# Answer before running cell
4**0.5 != 2
```




    False



Final Question: What is the boolean output of the cell block below?


```python
# two nested lists
l_one = [1,2,[3,4]]
l_two = [1,2,{'k1':4}]

# True or False?
l_one[2][0] >= l_two[2]['k1']
```




    False



## Great Job on your first assessment!
