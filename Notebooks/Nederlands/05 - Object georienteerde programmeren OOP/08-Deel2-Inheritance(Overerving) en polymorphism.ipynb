Polymorphism allows us to use a single interface with different underlying forms such as data types or classes. For example, we can have commonly named methods across classes or child classes. We have already seen one example above, when we override the method `show_type` in the `UCBAcc`. For parent class `Accelerometer` and child class `UCBAcc`, they both have a method named `show_type`, but they have different implementation. This ability of using single name with many forms acting differently in different situations greatly reduces our complexities.
