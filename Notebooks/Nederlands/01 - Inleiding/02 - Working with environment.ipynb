    "In dit hoofdstuk leer je over virtuele codeeromgevingen. Hiermee kun je alle pakketten die je gebruikt om analyses uit te voeren voor één project isoleren van de pakketten die je nodig hebt voor een ander project. Ze zijn een belangrijk onderdeel van het maken van een reproduceerbare analytische pijplijn (meer daarover in {ref}`wrkflow-rap` maar een belangrijk voordeel is dat anderen de door jou gebruikte omgeving kunnen reproduceren) en het is best practice om per project een geïsoleerde omgeving te hebben.\n",
    "\n",
    "Het is misschien gemakkelijker om het maken van aparte omgevingen te illustreren met een voorbeeld. Stel dat u Python 3.8, statsmodels en pandas gebruikt voor één project, project A. En voor project B gebruikt u Python 3.9 met numpy en scikit-learn. Zelfs met dezelfde versie van Python zou de beste praktijk zijn om twee afzonderlijke virtuele Python-omgevingen te hebben: omgeving A, met alles wat nodig is voor project A, en omgeving B, met alles wat nodig is voor project B. In het geval dat u verschillende versies van Python gebruikt, is dit niet alleen de beste praktijk, maar zelfs essentieel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Veel programmeertalen hebben nu een optie om pakketten en een versie van de taal in geïsoleerde omgevingen te installeren. In Python zijn er meerdere tools om verschillende omgevingen te beheren. Daarvan is de eenvoudigste om mee te werken waarschijnlijk [**Anaconda**](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) (afgekort conda), hoewel [**poetry**](https://python-poetry.org/) een andere sterke optie is.\n",
