    "Email systems are robust because they rely upon well-established protocols used by all email platforms across the internet. These protocols are defined and published by documents called [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) that stands for Request for Comments and resemble the [PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) from Python, but for protocols and patterns that define the operation of communication systems through the internet.\n",
